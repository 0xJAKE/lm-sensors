Okay, a new version is born... 
There are still many files from the old version lying around that
need to be ported - anyone have spare time ?

Currently, the following modules are running in the new mode:
	i2c.c		- main admin module & common interface
	i2c-dev.c 	- character device interface for the bus
	algo-bit.c	- Algorithms for bit banging
	bit-lp.c	- hw part for parallel port adapter, Philips interface
	bit-velle.c	- hw part for parallel port adapter, Vellemann K9000

The other modules, esp. algo-pcf.c still need to be converted. For the
hw specific mods, this should be relatively easy & quick.

* NOTE: The algo-pcf part is currently in the works, thanks to Hans Berglund

A simple driver example is in drivers -- a piece of code to access EEPROMs.
