This is a list of modifications between the stock i2c code as distributed
by Simon Vogl, and the code included in and beneath this directory. None
of these changes are important; you can still use a self-compiled version
of the i2c code and not compile the version in here.

! Changes marked with an exclamation mark *are* important, and *must*
  be applied! If there are changes like this in this list, you *must*
  use our version of the i2c module!

The current version of Simon's code is called mod-19990118.tar.gz.

Here come the changes:

! Fixed i2c_probe bug

* Algo-bit now scans the bus before registering the adapter.

! Renamed #define HW_B_MB to HW_B_VIA in i2c.h

! Added '#include <linux/page.h>' to i2c.h, to make it compile with 2.2 
  kernels.
 
* Moved files: bit-via.c and README.bit-via
  These are now under lm_sensors source tree as
   kernel/busses/i2c-via.c and doc/busses/i2c-via

* EXPORT_SYMBOL declarations put between #ifdef statements
  They only work if you use the Linux source tree Makefiles. As we want to
  use our own Makefile, we have removed them. This should have almost no
  influence on the resulting object code; a few more functions may be
  exported, but this should do no harm.

# Made i2c-core a bit quieter

* New file: Module.mk
  The Makefile fragment we use to compile the files in this directory.

* New file: MODIFICATIONS
  The file you are reading right now.

* Removed files: object files and executables
  Everywhere, remakeable files are removed, to keep the source distribution
  small and lean.
