This is a list of modifications between the stock i2c code as distributed
by Simon Vogl, and the code included in and beneath this directory. None
of these changes are important; you can still use a self-compiled version
of the i2c code and not compile the version in here.

! Changes marked with an exclamation mark *are* important, and *must*
  be applied! If there are changes like this in this list, you *must*
  use our version of the i2c module!

Here come the changes:

* rscid declarations are changed
  This is an unfortunate interaction between our CVS server and Simon's
  RCS (CVS?) server. As these ids do not seem to be accessed anywhere,
  there should be no change in the final object code

* Log entries are added
  Another RCS/CVS side effect. Our logs are sometimes put in the source
  code. As they are just comments, they will do no harm.

* EXPORT_SYMBOL declarations removed
  They only work if you use the Linux source tree Makefiles. As we want to
  use our own Makefile, we have removed them. This should have almost no
  influence on the resulting object code; a few more functions may be
  exported, but this should do no harm.

* bit-mb: Linux 2.0.x fixes
  Some small changes to make this file compile with 2.0 kernels. These
  changes will probably be included in the next i2c version.

* New file: Module.mk
  The Makefile fragment we use to compile the files in this directory.

* New file: MODIFICATIONS
  The file you are reading right now.

* Removed files: object files and executables
  Everywhere, remakeable files are removed, to keep the source distribution
  small and lean.

! i2c-core: i2c_del_adapter() change
  Replaced
    i2c_detach_client(client);
  with:
    client->driver->detach_client(client);

! i2c-core: function i2c_adapter_id added
