# healthd -- 	This is a simple daemon which can be used to alert you in the
#		event of a hardware health monitoring alarm by sending an 
#		email to the value of ADMIN_EMAIL (defined below).
#
# To Use  --	Simply start the daemon from a shell (may be backgrounded)
#
# Other details -- Checks status every 15 seconds.  Sends warning emails every
#		   ten minutes during alarm until the alarm is cleared.
#		   It won't start up if there is a pending alarm on startup.
#		   Very low loading on the machine (sleeps almost all the time).
#		   This is just an example.  It works, but hopefully we can
#		   get something better written. :')
#
# Requirements -- grep, mail, sensors, bash
#		  (You may need to alter the PATH, but probably not.)
