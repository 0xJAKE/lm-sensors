.TH ISADUMP 8 "March 2004"
.SH NAME
isadump \- examine ISA registers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B isadump
.I addrreg
.I datareg
.RI [ "bank " [ bankreg ]]
(for I\u2\dC-like access)
.br
.B isadump
.BI "-f " address
(for flat address space)

.SH DESCRIPTION
isadump is a small helper program to examine registers visible through the ISA
bus. It is intended to probe any chip that lives on the ISA bus working with an
address register and a data register (I\u2\dC-like access) or a flat 256 bytes
range.

.SH OPTIONS (I\u2\dC-like access mode)
At least two options must be provided to isadump. \fIaddrreg\fR contains the
ISA address of the address register for the chip to probe; \fIdatareg\fR
contains the address of the data register. Both addresses are integers between
0x0000 and 0x3FFF. Usually, if the chip's base address is 0x0nn0, the
address register is at 0x0nn5 and the data register is at 0x0nn6. The most
common base address for hardware monitoring chips is 0x0290.
.PP
The \fIbank\fR and \fIbankreg\fR parameters are useful on the W83781D and
similar chips (at the time of writing, all Winbond and Asus chips).
\fIbank\fR is an integer between 0 and 7, and \fIbankreg\fR is an integer
between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x4E). The W83781D data sheet has more
information on bank selection.

.SH OPTIONS (flat address space mode)
In flat mode (triggered by the \fB-f\fR flag), only one parameter must be
provided. \fIaddress\fR contains the ISA address of the address register
for the chip to probe; it is an integer between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.

.SH WARNING
Poking around in ISA data space is extremely dangerous.
Running isadump with random parameters can cause system
crashes, data loss, and worse!  Be extremely careful when using
this program.
