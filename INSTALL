INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The lm-sensors package, version 3, provides user-space support for the
hardware monitoring drivers in Linux 2.6.5 and later. For older kernel
versions, you have to use lm-sensors version 2.


Dependencies
============

Build-time dependencies:
* GNU make
* gcc
* bison
* flex
* libsysfs header files (from sysfsutils-devel)
* rrd header files (optional, for sensord)

Run-time dependencies:
* libsysfs (from sysfsutils)
* perl (for sensors-detect)
* rrd (optional, for sensord)


Compilation
===========

At the top of the Makefile are a couple of configuration variables that
you may want to change. There's a description of what each variable does
in the Makefile itself.

Compilation is done by `make all'. You will get a lot of warnings about
files which are not found, all ending in `.*d'. You can safely ignore
this; they contain dependency information, which is regenerated on the
spot.

`make install' installs the package (to /usr/local by default).


Using the sensors package
=========================

There is a scanning program installed called sensors-detect. It
will scan all available I2C and SMBus adapters for all known sensor
devices, and will also look for ISA, PCI and Super-I/O chips with
sensors, and give you a list of what kernel drivers you need to load
(using modprobe).

You can use the installed sensors program to get a report of all detected
sensor devices. There is also a manual page for this program. Calling
`sensors -s' will set the limits and other configuration settings 
specified in /etc/sensors.conf. Again, read the manual pages for more
information.

There are many auxiliary programs not installed. You can find them under
the prog subdirectory. A list can be found in doc/progs.
