.SH DESCRIPTION
.B int sensors_init(FILE *input);
.br
(Re)load the configuration file and the detected chips list. If this returns a value unequal to zero, you are in trouble; you can not assume anything will be initialized properly.

.B void sensors_cleanup(void);
.br
Clean-up function: You can't access anything after this, until the next sensors_init() call!
.br

\fBint sensors_parse_chip_name(const char *orig_name,
                            sensors_chip_name *res);\fP
.br
Parse a chip name to the internal representation. Return 0 on succes, <0 on error.

\fBint sensors_match_chip(sensors_chip_name chip1,
                       sensors_chip_name chip2);\fP
.br
Compare two chips name descriptions, to see whether they could match. Return 0 if it does not match, return 1 if it does match.

.B const char *sensors_get_adapter_name(int bus_nr);
.br
This function returns the adapter name of a bus number, as used within the
sensors_chip_name structure. If it could not be found, it returns NULL.

\fBint sensors_get_label(sensors_chip_name name, int feature,
                      char **result);\fP
.br
Look up the label which belongs to this chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! *result is newly allocated (free it yourself). This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

\fBint sensors_get_feature(sensors_chip_name name,
                        int feature, double *result);\fP
.br
Read the value of a feature of a certain chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

\fBint sensors_set_feature(sensors_chip_name name,
                        int feature, double value);\fP
.br
Set the value of a feature of a certain chip. Note that chip should not contain wildcard values! This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

.B int sensors_do_chip_sets(sensors_chip_name name);
.br
Execute all set statements for this particular chip. The chip may contain wildcards!  This function will return 0 on success, and <0 on failure.

\fBconst sensors_chip_name *sensors_get_detected_chips
                        (int *nr);\fP
.br
This function returns all detected chips, one by one. To start at the beginning of the list, use 0 for nr; NULL is returned if we are at the end of the list. Do not try to change these chip names, as they point to internal structures! Do not use nr for anything else.

This structure is used when you want to get all features of a specific chip.
.br
\fBtypedef struct sensors_feature_data {
.br
  int number;
.br
  const char *name;
.br
  sensors_feature_type type;
.br
  int mapping;
.br
  int compute_mapping;
.br
  int mode;
.br
} sensors_feature_data;\fP
.br
The mode field can be one of:
.br
SENSORS_MODE_NO_RW, SENSORS_MODE_R, SENSORS_MODE_W or SENSORS_MODE_RW.

\fBconst sensors_feature_data *sensors_get_all_features
      (sensors_chip_name name, int *nr);\fP
.br
This returns all features of a specific chip. They are returned in bunches:
everything with the same mapping is returned just after each other, with
the master feature in front (that feature does not map to itself, but
has SENSORS_NO_MAPPING as mapping field). nr is an internally used variable.
Set it to zero to start again at the begin of the list. If no more features
are found NULL is returned. Do not try to change the returned structure; you
will corrupt internal data structures.

\fBconst char *libsensors_version;\fP
.br
A string representing the version of libsensors.
