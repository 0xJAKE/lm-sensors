This is the completely rewritten version of lm_sensors, a collection of
modules for general SMBus access and hardware monitoring. There are quite
a few changes compared with 1.x.y versions; read doc/version-2 for the
most interesting ones.

WARNING! This is a BETA release. It is not compatible with any programs
which are built upon the 1.x.y versions, like wmlm78 or klm. We expect
version 2 will soon be supported by them, though (a new version of wmlm78
may already be released once you read this). As beta release, there
may be problems, and not all version 1 chips are yet supported. Not
everything is tested exhaustively, either, often because we simply do
not have access to the hardware. Please share your experiences, both
good and bad, regarding this package with us at <lm78@stimpy.netroedge.com>.

WARNING! If you downloaded this package through our CVS archive, you walk
the cutting edge. Things may not even compile! On the other hand, you will
be the first to profit from new drivers and other changes. Have fun!

As a rule of thumb: if you have a PIIX4 with LM78/79 and LM75 chips, things
should run without problem. The GL518 driver is mostly untested. All
supporting modules in the src directory should work without problem. If
you have a VIA chipset, we would like to hear whether you can access the
SMBus with it - this is not very well tested either. The new Winbond driver
should be all right, too. If you have a LM80, please share your experiences
with us.

We expect many updates and new releases the next few weeks (with both bug
fixes and new features), so check http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78 (our
homepage) often.

We could use some testers of hardware. If you own a specific monitoring
chip or I2C bus, and are willing to help us out, please contact us - even
if you did so before. Even if you have no programming knowledge, you could
help us by running new modules and reporting on the results and output. 
If you want to offer more substantial help, this is very welcome too, of
course. We have access to LM78(-J), LM79, LM75, Winbond W83781D and
GL518SM chips, and PIIX4 and VIA chipsets.


SMBus, also known as System Management Bus, is a protocol for communicating
through a I2C ('I squared C') bus. Many modern mainboards have a System
Management Bus. There are a lot of devices which can be connected to a
SMBus; the most notable are modern memory chips with EEPROM memories and
chips for hardware monitoring.

Most modern mainboards incorporate some form of hardware monitoring chips.
These chips read things like chip temperatures, fan rotation speeds and
voltage levels. There are quite a few different chips which can be used
by mainboard builders for approximately the same results.

Hardware monitoring chips are often connected to the SMBus, but often they
can also be connected to the ISA bus. The modules in this package usually
support both ways of accessing them.

Because the SMBus is just a special case of the generalized I2C bus, we
can simulate the SMBus protocol on plain I2C busses. These busses are
sometimes used in other parts of your computer. If a supported chip is
attached to one of these additional busses, they can be used too.

Please read INSTALL before trying to compile and install these modules.
There is a lot of additional documentation in the doc/ subdirectory.
Amnong these is a list of supported busses and chips. Regrettably, there
are too many mainboards to keep a list of busses and chips used on them.
We will provide a user-space utility which probes for the presence of
chips and busses in one of the next releases.

The developers of this package can be reached through the email address
<lm78@stimpy.netroedge.com>. Do not hesitate to mail us if you have questions,
suggestions, problems, want to contribute, or just want to report it works
for you. But please try to read the documentation and FAQ first before you ask
any questions!

In more human language, that means it is FORBIDDEN to link any application

does not fall under the GPL. This will probably be changed in the future.
In the meantime, you will have to contact us first if you want to do this.
