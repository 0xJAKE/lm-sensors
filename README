OVERVIEW OF THE LM_SENSORS PACKAGE AND SUMMARY OF SUPPORTED DEVICES

This is the completely rewritten version of lm_sensors, a collection of
modules for general SMBus access and hardware monitoring. There are quite
a few changes compared with 1.x.y versions; read doc/version-2 for the
most interesting ones.

WARNING! If you downloaded this package through our CVS archive, you walk
the cutting edge. Things may not even compile! On the other hand, you will
be the first to profit from new drivers and other changes. Have fun!

WARNING! The default module installation directory changed since version
2.2.1. If you don't change the directory in /etc/modules.conf (or
/etc/conf.modules), modprobe will probably load the wrong ones.

WARNING! Some things have changed since version 2.1.2. Most notably,
module piix4 is renamed i2c-piix4, module isa is renamed i2c-isa,
and module bit-mb is renamed i2c-via. You have been warned.

At least the following SMBus adapters are supported:
  Intel PIIX4 (used in most Intel chipsets)
  Intel ICH (used Intel 810 chipsets for Celeron processors)
  Acer Labs M1541 and M1543C (used in the Aladdin IV, V and Pro 2 chipsets)
  VIA Technologies 82C586B (used in most VIA chipsets)

At least the following hardware sensor chips are supported:
  National Semicoductor LM75, LM78, LM78-J, LM79 and LM80
  Winbond W83781D, W83782D, W83783S, and W83627HF
  Genesys Logic GL518SM (several revisions)
  Analog Devices ADM1021 and ADM9240
  SiS Southbridge (integrated in the chipset; the I2C adapter will also be
    supported in the near future)
  Maxim MAX1617 and MAX1617A
  Dallas Semiconductor DS1780
  Hewlett Packard Maxilife (several revisions)
  Intel Xeon processor embedded sensors

We also support some miscellaneous chips:
  Linear Technologies LTC1710
  Dimms with EEPROMs

We could use some testers of hardware. If you own a specific monitoring
chip or I2C bus, and are willing to help us out, please contact us - even
if you did so before. Even if you have no programming knowledge, you could
help us by running new modules and reporting on the results and output. 
If you want to offer more substantial help, this is very welcome too, of
course.


SMBus, also known as System Management Bus, is a protocol for communicating
through a I2C ('I squared C') bus. Many modern mainboards have a System
Management Bus. There are a lot of devices which can be connected to a
SMBus; the most notable are modern memory chips with EEPROM memories and
chips for hardware monitoring.

Most modern mainboards incorporate some form of hardware monitoring chips.
These chips read things like chip temperatures, fan rotation speeds and
voltage levels. There are quite a few different chips which can be used
by mainboard builders for approximately the same results.

Hardware monitoring chips are often connected to the SMBus, but often they
can also be connected to the ISA bus. The modules in this package usually
support both ways of accessing them.

Because the SMBus is just a special case of the generalized I2C bus, we
can simulate the SMBus protocol on plain I2C busses. These busses are
sometimes used in other parts of your computer. If a supported chip is
attached to one of these additional busses, they can be used too.

Please read INSTALL before trying to compile and install these modules.
There is a lot of additional documentation in the doc/ subdirectory.
Amnong these is a list of supported busses and chips. Regrettably, there
are too many mainboards to keep a list of busses and chips used on them.
On the other hand, we provide a program called 'sensors-detect' which
tries to figure out what hardware is available on your system.

The developers of this package can be reached through the email address
<lm78@stimpy.netroedge.com>. Do not hesitate to mail us if you have questions,
suggestions, problems, want to contribute, or just want to report it works
for you. But please try to read the documentation and FAQ first before you ask
any questions!

through anonymous CVS; see doc/cvs for more information.

Note that at this moment, libsensors falls under the GPL, not the LGPL.
In more human language, that means it is FORBIDDEN to link any application
to the library, even to the shared version, if the application itself
does not fall under the GPL. This will probably be changed in the future.
In the meantime, you will have to contact us first if you want to do this.
