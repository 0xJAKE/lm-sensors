This is a list of modules, the modules they depend on, and the module
parameters they define. First, some things about managing all these 
modules.

The hardcore way is to insmod each of them by hand. This is not very
practical, though. It is better to install them in a subdirectory that
modprobe examines. /lib/modules/current/extra/misc comes to mind.
You need to add this path to your /etc/modules.conf (or /etc/conf.modules,
which file is used depends on your distribution):
  (modules-2.0.0):
    path[misc]=/lib/modules/current/extra/misc
  (modutils-2.1.x):
    path=/lib/modules/current/extra
Do always a 'killall -HUP kerneld; depmod -a' after changing either your
configuration file or changing a module in one of the module directories.

Now you can do 'modprobe lm78', and all dependent modules are loaded
automatically. You could, of course, add this statement (and related
statements for other drivers) somewhere in your rc files. But, most
distributions are set up to load automatically all files in the
'boot' directories on system start, so why not use this? The best
way to do this is to create directory /lib/modules/boot, and to
put *links* to the real modules in there. Why links? Well, by linking
to /lib/modules/current/whatever, this will function for any kernel
(provided /lib/modules/current is correctly set up to point to the
current kernel). So:
  mkdir -p /lib/modules/boot
  ln -s ../current/extra/misc/lm78.o /lib/modules/boot/lm78.o
  # etc.

It is also possible to specify default options, that you would normally
enter at the insmod command, in the configuration file. The syntax is
as follows:
  options i2c-core debug=2

With the above, the managing of all those modules is suddenly no problem
at all!


i2c-core:
  The core i2c module (surprise!). Almost everything else depends on this one.
  Module parameters:
    i2c_debug (i) Set debug level

i2c-proc: i2c-core
  Creates /proc/bus/i2c* files.

smbus: i2c-core
  SMBus emulation on i2c busses. Base algorithm, on which SMBus-only adapters
  rely.

piix4: smbus i2c-core
  PIIX4 SMBus access.

isa: i2c-core
  Defines the ISA bus as being a I2C adapter. It isn't, of course; but this is
  often used by sensor client modules, to keep the code small and simple.

sensors: i2c-core
  General purpose routines for sensor client modules

lm78: sensors smbus i2c-core
  LM78 (and LM78-J, LM79) chip driver

(To do: i2c modules)
