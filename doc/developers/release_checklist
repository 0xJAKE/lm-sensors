CHECKLIST FOR NEW RELEASES
==========================

Release steps:
- Check out lm-sensors
- Update if necessary, the version number of libsensors
  (edit lib/Module.mk and change LIBMAINVER and/or LIBMINORVER)
  Remember: update main number when interface changes, minor if new
  functionality is added, and patch if only bugs are fixed.
  `svn diff -r Vx-y-z lib' is your friend.
- Update the CHANGES file (add the release date)
- Update lm_sensors.lsm (Version, Entered-date and Primary-site) and send
  it to the LSM by mailing it to lsm@qqx.org with the subject `add' (no
  quotes).
- Update version.h
- Commit
- Tag the release using SVN:
  svn copy http://lm-sensors.org/svn/lm-sensors/trunk \
      http://lm-sensors.org/svn/lm-sensors/tags/V2-x-x \
      -m "Create tag 'V2-x-x'."
- Remove 'SVN' related files/directories (e.g. rm -fR `find . -name .svn`)
- Rename lm_sensors2 to lm_sensors-#.#.#
- Tar it up and post it (sign it)
- Make sure the file permissions on both the archive and the signature
  are correct (664)

After release, remember to:
- Copy to mirrors
- Announce on Freshmeat
- Put back ???? for dates
- Prep CHANGES files for next release
- Mark the corresponding release milestone as complete using trac-admin
  e.g. 'trac-admin /srv/lm-sensors.org/trac milestone completed 2.10.2 2006-12-31'
- Create a new release milestone using trac-admin
  e.g. 'trac-admin /srv/lm-sensors.org/trac milestone add 2.10.2 2006-12-31'
