This is some documenation for the ltc1710 driver for the Linear
Technologies LTC1710.

The LTC1710 is a simple dual switch device with a SMBus interface.  It can
switch a supply voltage to either of its two output pins independantly
from the built-in SMBus interface.

For each sensed LTC1710 there is a directory which looks something like:
ltc1710-i2c-1-59

For each directory there are the following files:

* switch1 (LTC1710_SYSCTL_SWITCH_1)
  Simply contains either a 1 or 0 depending on whether the switch is
  currently turned on or off.
* switch2 (LTC1710_SYSCTL_SWITCH_2)
  Works the same way as switch1, but is for the second switch.

Some notes: The LTC1710 is a *very* simple I2C/SMBus device.  It does not
support reads, so the status of the switches isn't polled, but rather
remembered.  The LTC1710 has enough 'umph' to drive 300mA with only 0.4 Ohm
impedence (in an 'on' state).  This works well for LEDs, or to drive other
devices (MOSFETs and such) which can multiply the switching effect.  The
LTC1710 also contains an emergency over-temperature shut-off in the case
of too much current flow.  Switch 2 switches the Vcc voltage on/off, but
Switch 1 switches the voltage present on pin 1 (0V to Vcc).
