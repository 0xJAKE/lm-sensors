Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductors LM92
temperature sensor.

Each LM92 temperature sensor supports a single temperature sensor.
Temperatures are exported to proc in degrees celsius * 10000 (in other
words temperatures are accurate to 4 decimal places). There are alarms
for high, low, and critical thresholds. There's also an hysterisis to
control the thresholds for resetting alarms.

At the moment the driver controls these sensors in comparator mode and the
interrupt pins (INT, T_CRIT_A) are ignored.

Hardware Configurations
-----------------------

The only thing that can be changed is enabling of the fault queue. Doing so
ensures that alarms will only be triggered if 4 consecutive readings all
cross the alarm thresholds. You can enable this behaviour by uncommenting
the #define in the driver source, and then recompile/reinstall.
