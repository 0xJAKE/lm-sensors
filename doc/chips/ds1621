Description
-----------

The DS1621 implements one temperature sensor. Limits can be set through the
Overtemperature register and Hysteresis register. Each value can be 
set and read to half-degree accuracy.
An alarm is issued when the temperature gets higher then the Overtemperature
value; or drops below the Hysteresis value.

It stays on until reset by the kernel module.

All temperatures are in degrees Celcius, and are guaranteed within a 
range of -55 to +125 degrees.

The DS1621 supplies the temperature data in a format common with chips
like the LM75, LM77 and DS75, DS1775.
While the DS1621 has three additional bits of accuracy
(12 vs. 9 for the LM75), the additional bits are not supported.

The driver also supports the DS1625. It does not distinguish the 1625 from
the 1621. The chip prefix in /proc is always ds1621.
The difference in the chips is that the 1621 supports additional registers
for greater accuracy. The driver does not use these registers.
The DS1625 has been discontinued by Dallas Semi, they recommend the
DS1621 for new designs.
