Supports the following Winbond chips:

Chip	#vin	#fanin	#pwm	#temp	wchipid	i2c	ISA
w83781d	7	3	0	3	0x10	yes	yes
w83782d	9	3	2-4	3	0x30	yes	yes
w83783s	5-6	3	2	1-2	0x40	yes	no


The driver only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.




To do:
-----
 782d/783s clock speed select
 782d beep 3 register
 782d programmable pins
 783s temp2 (labeled as temp1 in data sheet) at different location
      than 781d/782d, not implemented yet.
 781d R-T table
 782d/783s undocumented thermistor/PII/3904 select bits


Notes:
-----
  783s has no in1 for compatibility with the 781d/782d.

  783s pin is programmable for -5V or temp1; defaults to -5V,
       no control in driver so temp1 doesn't work.

  782d and 783s datasheets differ on which is pwm1 and which is pwm2.
       We chose to follow 782d.

  782d and 783s pin is programmable for fan3 input or pwm2 output;
       defaults to fan3 input.
       no control in driver so pwm2 doesn't work.

  782d has pwm1-2 for isa, pwm1-4 for i2c. (pwm3-4 share pins with
       the isa pins)
