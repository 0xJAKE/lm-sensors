Description
-----------

The Myson MTP008 is similar in function to the Winbond W83781D and the
National Semi LM78. See documentation for those chips for an overview.


The MTP008 chip has three inputs that are configurable.
One input is always temp1, and the sensor type is configured with the sensor1 entry.
One input is either in4 or temp2, and is configured with the sensor2 entry.
One input is either in5 or temp3, and is configured with the sensor3 entry.

We are making the initial assumption that
AIN4 is to be configured as PII temp sensor 2.
We are also making the assumption that
AIN5 is hooked up to the -12V sensing circuit.
This is the configuration on the Tyan S1824D motherboard.

Setting temp sensors 1 and 2 to be a PII sensors is done as follows:

         Register 0x57: 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
                                | \ / +-- AIN5/VT3 with AIN5
                                |  +----- AIN4/VT2/PII with PII
                                +-------- VT1/PII with PII


The MTP008 has sensor type selection in /proc like the Winbond W83782D.
However, the appropriate values used to make the selection are different.

To select a sensor type, echo the value to the /proc entry, for example:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/dev/sensors/mtp008-i2c-0-2d/sensor1

Sensor selection is as follows:

      Value	Function					Valid on sensors
      -----	--------					----------------
	1	Analog input (not for temperature sensing)	2,3
	2	Thermistor					1,2,3
	3	Pentium diode					1,2
