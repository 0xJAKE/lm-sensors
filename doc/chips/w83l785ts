Description
-----------

The W83L785TS-S is a digital temperature sensor. It senses the
temperature of a single external diode. The high limit is
defined as 85 or 100 degrees C through a combination of external
resistors, so the user cannot change it.

All temperature values are given in degrees Celcius. Resolution
is 1.0 degree. See the data sheet for details.

The w83l785ts driver will not update its values more frequently than
every other second; reading them more often will do no harm, but will
return 'old' values.
