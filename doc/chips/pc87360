Description
-----------

The National Semiconductor PC87360 Super I/O chip contains monitoring and
PWM control circuitry for two fans. The PC87363 chip is similar, and the
PC87364 chip has monitoring and PWM control for a third fan.

The National Semiconductor PC87365 and PC87366 Super I/O chips are complete
hardware monitoring chipsets, not only controling and monitoring three fans,
but also monitoring eleven voltage inputs and two (PC87365) or six
(PC87366) remote temperatures.


Fan Monitoring
--------------

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (revolutions per minute). An alarm
is triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit.
A different alarm is triggered if the fan speed is too low to be measured.
It is suggested to increase the fan divider (which is really a clock
divider) in this case.

Fan readings are affected by a programmable clock divider (1, 2, 4 or 8).
By changing the divider, you give the readings more range or accuracy.

                measurable      around 3000     accurate
    divider     speed (RPM)     RPM (RPM)       speed (RPM)
         1        1882              18           6928
         2         941              37           4898
         4         470              74           3464
         8         235             150           2449

For the curious, here is how the values above were computed:
 * slowest measurable speed: clock/(255*divider)
 * accuracy around 3000 RPM: 3000^2/clock
 * highest accurate speed: sqrt(clock*100)
The clock speed for the PC87360 family is 480 kHz. I arbitrarily chose 100
RPM as the lowest acceptable accuracy.

Note that not all RPM values can be represented. This is not only true for
the measured speeds, but also for the programmable low limits, so don't be
surprised if you try to set, say, fan1_min to 2900 and it finaly reads
2909. Likewise, if you try to set fan1_min to 0, it'll be set to the
lowest representable RPM value (depending on the divider).


Fan Control
-----------

PWM (pulse width modulation) values range from 0 to 255, with 0 meaning
that the fan is stopped, and 255 meaning that the fan goes at full speed.

Be extremely careful when changing PWM values. Low PWM values, even
non-zero, can stop the fan, which may cause irreversible damage to your
hardware if temperature increases too much. When changing PWM values, go
step by step and keep an eye on temperatures.

One user reported problems with PWM. Changing PWM values would break fan
speed readings. No explanation nor fix could be found.


Temperature Monitoring
----------------------

Temperatures are reported in degrees Celcius. Each temperature measured has
associated low, high and overtemperature limits, each of which triggers an
alarm when crossed.

The first two temperature channels are external. The third one (PC87366
only) is internal.

The PC87366 has three additional temperature channels, based on
thermistors (as opposed to thermal diodes for the first temperature
channels). For technical reasons, these channels are held by the VLM
(voltage level monitor) logical device, not the TMS (temperature
measurement) one. The formula to convert the measured voltage into a
temperature isn't known, so the driver doesn't handle these temperature
channels at all yet.


Voltage Monitoring
------------------

Voltages are reported relatively to a reference voltage, either internal or
external. Some of them (in7:Vsb, in8:Vdd and in10:AVdd) are divided by two
internally, you will have to compensate in sensors.conf. Others (in0 to in6)
are likely to be divided externally. The meaning of each of these inputs as
well as the values of the resistors used for division is left to the
motherboard manufacturers, so you will have to document yourself and edit
sensors.conf accordingly. National Semiconductor has a document with
recommended resistor values for some voltages, but this still leaves much
room for per motherboard specificities, unfortunately.

Each voltage measured has associated low and high limit, each of which
triggers an alarm when crossed.


General Remarks
---------------

If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register
is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already
have disappeared! Note that all hardware registers are read whenever any
data is read (unless it is less than 2 seconds since the last update, in
which case cached values are returned instead). As a consequence, when
a once-only alarm triggers, it may take 2 seconds for it to show, and 2
more seconds for it to disappear.

Monitoring of in9 isn't enabled at lower init levels (<3) because that
channel measures the battery voltage (Vbat). It is a known fact that
repeatedly sampling the battery voltage reduces its lifetime. National
Semiconductor smartly designed their chipset so that in9 is sampled only
once every 1024 sampling cycles (that is every 34 minutes at the default
sampling rate), so the effect is attenuated, but still present.


Limitations
-----------

There are a few unimplemented configuration options at the moment. We'll
add them if someone needs them.

The datasheets suggests that some values (fan mins, fan dividers)
shouldn't be changed once the monitoring has started, but we ignore that
recommendation. We'll reconsider if it actually causes trouble.
