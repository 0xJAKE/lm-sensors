Kernel driver `lm75.o'

Prefixes: lm75 (LM75, I2C)

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM75, a
`Digital Temperature Sensor and Thermal Watchdog with Two-Wire Interface'.

The LM75 implements one temperature sensor. Limits can be set through the
Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteris register. Each value can be 
set and read to half-degree accuracy.
An alarm is issued (usually to a connected LM78) when the temperature
gets higher then the Overtemperature Shutdown value; it stays on until
the temperature falls below the Hysteris value.
All temperatures are in degrees Celcius.

The LM75 only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.


/proc and sysctl interface files:
  * temp (LM75_SYSCTL_TEMP)
    Overtemperature Shutdown Value (RW,1), Hysteris Value (RW,1) and Current 
    Temperature (R,1).
