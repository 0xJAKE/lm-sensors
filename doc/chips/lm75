Kernel driver `lm75.o'
=====================

Status: Complete and well-tested

Supported chips: 
  * National Semiconductors LM75
    Prefix: `lm75'
    Addresses scanned: I2C 0x48 - 0x4f (inclusive)
    Datasheet: Publicly available at the National Semiconductors website


Description
-----------

The LM75 implements one temperature sensor. Limits can be set through the
Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteris register. Each value can be 
set and read to half-degree accuracy.
An alarm is issued (usually to a connected LM78) when the temperature
gets higher then the Overtemperature Shutdown value; it stays on until
the temperature falls below the Hysteris value.
All temperatures are in degrees Celcius, and are guaranteed within a 
range of -55 to +125 degrees.

The LM75 only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often
will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.

The LM75 is usually used in combination with LM78-like chips, to measure
the temperature of the processor(s).
