The is the driver for the HP MaxiLife Health monitoring system
as used in the line of HP Kayak Workstation PC's.

The driver supports the following MaxiLife firmware versions:

0) HP KAYAK XU/XAs (Dual Pentium II Slot 1, Deschutes/Klamath)
1) HP KAYAK XU (Dual Xeon [Slot 2] 400/450 Mhz)
2) HP KAYAK XA (Pentium II Slot 1, monoprocessor)

Currently firmware auto detection is not implemented. To use the
driver load it with the correct option for you Kayak. For example:

insmod maxilife.o maxi_version=0 | 1 | 2

maxi_version=0 is the default


The lm75's are indeed accessable in the regular way via the lm75 module.
They worked out of the box. However, I don't use the "raw" lm75 info.
MaxiLife takes care of reading out the lm75's and converts the values to
temperatures. Compared to some of the other monitoring controllers MaxiLife
is quite advanced. It takes care of a lot of issues, like setting ranges,
raising alarms, etc. Machines with MaxiLife also have a little LCD display
on their front (lcd is at address 0x54). The idea is that later versions
of the driver will write health info on the lcd (a bit like lcdproc).
