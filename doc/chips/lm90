Description
-----------

The LM90 is a digital temperature sensor. It senses its own temperature as
well as the temperature of up to one external diode. It is compatible
with many other devices such as the LM86, the LM89, the ADM1032, the
MAX6657 and the MAX6658. Of these, only the ADM1032 is officially
supported for now, but the others can probably be successfully forced.

The specificity of this family of chipsets over the ADM1021/LM84
family is that it features critical limits with hysteresis, and an
increased resolution of the remote temperature measurement.

The different chipsets of the family are not stricly identical, although
very similar. This driver doesn't handle any specific feature for now,
but could if there ever was a need for it. For reference, here comes a
non-exhaustive list of specific features:

LM90:
  * Filter and alert configuration register at 0xBF.
  * ALERT is triggered by temperatures over critical limits.

ADM1032:
  * Consecutive alert register at 0x22.
  * Conversion averaging.
  * Up to 64 conversions/s.
  * ALERT is triggered by open remote sensor.

All temperature values are given in degrees Celcius. Resolution
is 1.0 degree for the local temperature, 0.125 degree for the remote
temperature. According to the datasheets, the ADM1032 has a better
range and accuracy than the LM90 (but is also way more expensive).
See the datasheets for details.

Each sensor has its own high and low limits, plus a critical limit.
Additionally, there is a relative hysteresis value common to both critical
values.

The lm90 driver will not update its values more frequently than every
other second; reading them more often will do no harm, but will return
'old' values.
