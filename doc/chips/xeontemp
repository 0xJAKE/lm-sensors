Description
-----------

Xeon and other Intel processors with an embedded i2c temperature
sensor look very similar to an adm1021.
The Xeon has only one sensor where the adm1021 has two.
Not all Xeon processors have this feature.
If you have an Intel processor, and sensors-detect recommended
the adm1021 driver, and the address is one of
0x18, 0x1a, 0x29, 0x2b, 0x4c, or 0x4e, and when using the
adm1021 driver, temp1 is invalid but temp2 looks correct, then
it is likely you should use this driver instead.

See the adm1021 documentation for more information.
