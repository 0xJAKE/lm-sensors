This file documents the lm75 directories.

There will be one directory created for each detected LM75 chip. As LM75
chips can only be on a SMBus, they will be called lm75-i2c-?-??, with
the first question mark being the number of the i2c bus (see /proc/bus/i2c
for a list of them, if i2c-proc is loaded), and the SMBus (I2C) address
of the chip at the end. An LM75 is uniquely characterised with these
two numbers. /proc/sys/dev/sensors/chips contains the SYSCTL values for
all chip directories.

Within each LM75 directory, you can find the following files:
* temp (LM75_SYSCTL_TEMP)
  A list of three numbers. The first number is the Overtemperature Shutdown
  value, the second number is Hysteris value, and the third number is the
  current temperature. The first two values can be modified. Each value can
  be set and read to half-degree accuracy. All values are in degrees Celcius.
  An alarm is issued (usually to a connected LM78) when the temperature 
  gets higher then the Overtemperature Shutdown value; it stays on until
  the temperature falls below the Hysteris value.
  If accessed through sysctl, this is a list of longs, each being the
  temperature times 10.

The data for each LM75 is updated each 1.5 seconds, but only if it is actually
read.
