The lm_sensors team gratefully acknowledges the following donations.

Drivers are very difficult to develop without actual hardware.
Generally, the work goes quickly once we have the hardware.

Evaluation boards are fine. Real computer hardware is even better
because it let us do real-world testing over a longer period of time,
and also supports the project in general.

If you would like to make a donation, please contact us at
sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com. Thanks!
