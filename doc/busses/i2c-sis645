Description
-----------

This SMBus only driver is known to work on motherboards with the SiS645/SiS961
chipset combination.  The driver was developed without benefit of a proper
datasheet from SiS.  The SMBus registers are assumed compatible with those of
the SiS630, although they are located in a completely different place.  Thanks
to Alexander Malysh <amalysh@web.de> for providing the SiS630 datasheet (and 
driver).

The command "lspci" as root should produce something like these lines:

00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]: Unknown device 0645
00:02.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513
00:02.1 SMBus: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]: Unknown device 0016

(kernel versions later than 2.4.18 may fill in the "Unknown"s)

If the SMBus line is missing, then the BIOS on the board has disabled the
device.  This driver is capable of enabling it, as long as the kernel has
CONFIG_HOTPLUG enabled.  In that case, the SMBus device will appear in "lspci"
after the driver is loaded.  Note that you need to rebuild lm_sensors AFTER
running "make config" or equivalent on your kernel, otherwise the i2c-sis645
driver will not build in this support.

I suspect that this driver could be made to work for the following SiS chipsets
as well: 648/963, 651/962, 645DX/961, 650/961, 735, 635, and 635T.
If anyone owns a board with those chips AND is willing to risk crashing &
burning an otherwise well-behaved kernel in the name of progress... please
contact me at <mhoffman@lightlink.com> or via the project's mailing list:
<sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com>.  Please send bug reports and/or success
stories as well.

The driver does not support SMBus block reads/writes; I may add them if a
scenario is found where they're needed.
