Module Parameters

force_addr=0xaddr	Set the I/O base address. Useful for boards
			that don't set the address in the BIOS. Does not do a
			PCI force; the device must still be present in lspci.
			Don't use this unless the driver complains that the
			base address is not set.
			Example: 'modprobe i2c-sis5595 force_addr=0x290'
