None.

Description
-----------

If you see something like this:

00:07.2 SMBus: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 19
        I/O ports at d400 [size=32]

in your 'lspci -v', then this driver is for your chipset.

Process Call Support
--------------------

The chip supports it, but it's not implemented in the driver at the moment.

SMBus 2.0 Support
-----------------

The chip supports SMBus 2.0, however the only extension the driver
supports is PEC. Slave mode or host notification are not implemented.


Note that for the 8111, there are two SMBus adapters. The SMBus 2.0 adapter is
supported by this driver, and the SMBus 1.0 adapter is supported
by the i2c-amd756 driver.
