Kernel driver `i2c-adm8111.o'

Status: Slightly tested.

Supported adapters:
    * AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 PCI interface

Datasheets:
	AMD datasheet not yet available, but almost everything can be found in
        publically available ACPI 2.0 specification, which the adapter follows.

Module Parameters
-----------------

None.

Description
-----------

If you see something like this:

00:07.2 SMBus: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 19
        I/O ports at d400 [size=32]

in your 'lspci -v', then this driver is for your chipset.

Process Call Support
--------------------

Supported.

SMBus 2.0 Support
-----------------

Supported. Both PEC and block process call support is implemented.
Slave mode or host notification are not yet implemented.

Notes
-----

Note that for the 8111, there are two SMBus adapters. The SMBus 2.0 adapter is
supported by this driver, and the SMBus 1.0 adapter is supported
by the i2c-amd756 driver.

The 8111 used with the AMD Hammer. While the module should work either with
CONFIG_X86 or CONFIG_X86_64, it will only be compiled with CONFIG_X86_64
(as it was the easiest way to prevent compilation in 2.2 kernels).
If you would like to compile it for CONFIG_X86, modify kernel/busses/Module.mk.
