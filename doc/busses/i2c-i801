Description
-----------

The ICH (properly known as the 82801AA) and ICH0 (82801AB)
are Intel chips that are a part of Intel's '810' chipset
which is designed for Celeron-based PCs.

They are quite similar to Intel's PIIX4 chip, at least in the
SMBus controller.

See the file i2c-piix4 for details.
