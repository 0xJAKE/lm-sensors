This is a list of additional programs, that may or may not be installed by
`make install', and that usually can be found in the `prog' directory of
this package.

* prog/config/grab_busses.sh (written in bash and awk, not installed)
  This program helps you generate the `bus' statements for your configuration
  file. It read /proc/bus/i2c (or the file specified on the command-line),
  and prints to stdout `bus' statements reflecting the currently detected
  adapters.
* prog/dump/i2cdump (written in C, not installed)
  This program helps to dump the registers of a I2C device that understands
  the 'byte data' or 'word data' SMBus protocols. Usual syntax:
    ./i2cdump 0 0x49 b
  Here the '0' stands for i2c-0 (check /proc/bus/i2c to find out which bus
  you need), '0x49' is the device address, and 'b' or 'w' stands for byte
  or word data.
* prog/dump/isadump (written in C, not installed)
  This program helps to dump the registers of LM78-like chips, or more
  exactly, chips which use an I/O-port for its address and one as its
  data register. Usual syntax: 
     ./isadump 0x295 0x296
* prog/eeprom/decode-dimms.pl (written in Perl 5, not installed)
  This program decodes the information generated by the `eeprom.o' module.
  It will only work for the installed eeprom module from the src/ directory,
  not for the old one in the i2c/drivers/ directory.
* prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh (written in bash, not installed)
  This script creates the /dev/i2c-* files. Please check the source before
  you run it, as you may need to set some variables first.
* prog/sensors/sensors (written in C, installed by `make install')
  This pretty-prints the information provided by the modules. It is a normal
  console application, using stdin and stdout. It is essential, because
  unlike the raw /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*/* files, it takes your configuration
  file into account.

There are some programs distributed with Simon Vogl's i2c package too:
* i2c/detect/detect (written in C, not installed)
  This program needs module `i2c-dev.o' to be loaded. It scans the complete
  address range of a certain bus for connected devices. It will only work
  for i2c-level drivers (not for PIIX4 busses).
* i2c/eeprom/eeprom (written in C, not installed)
  This program needs the i2c `eeprom.o' module (that is the one that is not
  installed; it can be found in the i2c/drivers/ directory). It reads from
  or writes to the eeprom.
