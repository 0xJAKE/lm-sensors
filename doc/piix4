The PIIX4 (properly known as the 82371AB) is an Intel chip with a lot of
functionality. Among other things, it implements the PCI bus. One of its
minor functions is implementing a System Management MBus. This is a true 
SMBus - you can not access it on I2C levels. The good news is that it
natively understands SMBus commands and you do not have to worry about
timing problems. The bad news is that non-SMBus devices connected to it
can confuse it mightily. Yes, this is known to happen...

Cat /proc/pci, and see whether it contains an entry like this:

  Bus  0, device   1, function  3:
    Bridge: Intel 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 1).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  

Bus and device numbers may differ, but the function number must be identical
(like many PCI devices, the PIIX4 incorporates a number of different
'functions', which can be considered as separate devices). If you find such
an entry, you have a PIIX4 SMBus controller.

On some computers (most notably, some Dells), the SMBus is disabled by
default. If you compile the piix4 module with '-DFORCE_PIIX4_ENABLE',
it will try to enable it. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS! If the BIOS did not
set up a correct address for this module, you could get in big trouble
(read: crashes, data corruption, etc.). Try this only as a last resort
(try BIOS updates first, for example), and backup first!
