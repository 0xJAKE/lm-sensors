There have been many, many changes between version 1 and version 2 of this
package. Some of the more important ones:

* Fully modular setup. This makes it much easier to support new hardware,
  and consumes less kernel memory.
* Full support for I2C busses. This includes the VIA chipset I2C bus. If it
  is supported by Simon Vogl, it is supported by us.
* Many things which were done in kernel space are now done in user space.
  The most obvious result is the absence of /proc/sensors. Use instead the
  supplied program.
* No more limits on the number of chips.
* All detected chips get their own directory under /proc/sys/dev/sensors
* /proc/bus contains a list of all I2C/SMBus adapters found
* All code has been completely rewritten.
