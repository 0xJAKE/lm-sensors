Many, many things. Most notably:

* 2.1 kernel tests; at this moment, only 2.0 compiles have been tried.
* Make it SMP-safe: there are no spinlocks yet. They are needed at many
  places, probably (everywhere where global vars are accessed).
* Write smbus_access_i2c in smbus.c
* Write piix4_* in piix4.c
* Complete lm78 driver
* Extend dev interface for SMBus
* Create entries in /proc/bus: a list of all registered busses, and for
  each bus, a file with registered clients (partially done)
* Write all other drivers
* How to make drivers detect thing *not*; for example, if a Winbond is 
  present, the LM75 driver should not try to access its simulated
  LM75 chips!
* Write a userland-library for SMBus/i2c access (through the /dev interface)
* Write a userland detection program for busses (clients are less important;
  but perhaps needed too).
