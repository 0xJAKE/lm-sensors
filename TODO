Many, many things. Most notably:

* 2.1 kernel tests; at this moment, only 2.0 compiles have been tried.
* Make it SMP-safe: there are no spinlocks yet. They are needed at many
  places, probably (everywhere where global vars are accessed).
* Extend sensors.c with a file /proc/sys/dev/sensors/chips, which lists
  all directories under /proc/sys/dev/sensors with their SYSCTL id
  (needed for good sysctl access).
* Write smbus_access_i2c in smbus.c
* Write piix4_* in piix4.c
* Make lm78.c detect 'double hits', (same chip connected to both SMBus and
  ISA).
* Check whether some lm78 functionality is chip-generic and can be moved to
  sensors.c.
* Rename i2c-proc.c to i2c-user.c, and extend it with /dev entries;
  or, create a better i2c-dev.c, that understands SMBus commands.
* Write all other drivers
* How to make drivers detect thing *not*; for example, if a Winbond is 
  present, the LM75 driver should not try to access its simulated
  LM75 chips (in this case, simply disable them - but what if the LM75
  driver was loaded first?).
* Write a userland-library for SMBus/i2c access (through the /dev interface)
* Write a userland detection program for busses (clients are less important;
  but perhaps needed too).
