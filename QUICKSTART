NOTE: PLEASE SKIM THE INSTALL DOCUMENT, OR BETTER YET READ IT CAREFULLY!
The instructions in this document will only work if you have a standard
system, and may cause problems.

Quickstart:

  * Make sure you have the kernel tree corresponding to your current
    kernel in /usr/src/linux. Distribution kernels usually won't do,
    compile your own from a 'vanilla' tree (get one from
    ftp://ftp.kernel/org/pub/linux/kernel/).

  * Install the latest i2c package. This may be necessary even if
    you have a 2.4 kernel.

  * Do `make'.
    The warnings about .d files at the start are harmless.
    If you have compile problems, you probably skipped step 2.
    Go back and install the latest i2c package.

  * Do (as root) `make install'.

  * Do a `depmod -a'.

  * Add  the line
      /usr/local/lib 
    to /etc/ld.so.conf if it is not there yet.

  * Do a `ldconfig'.

  * Run `prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh' to create the device files

  * Run `prog/detect/sensors-detect' to detect your hardware, put
    the lines it suggests into /etc/conf.modules or /etc/modules.conf
    (whichever one exists) and enter the modprobe lines it suggests.
    Add the line `sensors -s' after the modprobe lines.

  * Reboot or else type in the modprobe lines and `sensors -s'

  * Run `sensors' to see your output.

  * That's all folks!
