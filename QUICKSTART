LM_SENSORS QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------

NOTE: PLEASE SKIM THE INSTALL DOCUMENT, OR BETTER YET READ IT CAREFULLY!
The instructions in this document will generally work if you have a standard
system, but not always!!

Quickstart for i2c option 1 (modules) and lm_sensors option 1 (modules).
This is the recommended EASIEST METHOD.
Other methods are described in INSTALL.
------------------------------------------

  * Make sure you have the kernel tree corresponding to your current
    kernel in /lib/modules/(uname -r)/build.
    Even if the source is there, it may not correspond to your running
    kernel. If so, you will have to recompile your kernel.

  * Verify that your i2c support in the kernel is configured as
    modules or is disabled. If it is compiled-in, you obviously
    cannot replace it with modules in the next step.

  * Download, build, and install the latest i2c package,
    (i2c-2.7.0 or later).
    Quickstart for i2c: make; make install; depmod -a

  * Go back to the lm_sensors directory. Do `make'.
    The warnings about .d files at the start are harmless.
    If you have compile problems, you probably should not have skipped step 3.
    Go back and install the latest i2c package.
    If you still have compile problems, you probably should not
    have skipped the i2c step above.

  * Do (as root) `make install'.

  * Do (as root) `depmod -a'.

  * Add  the line
      /usr/local/lib 
    to /etc/ld.so.conf if it is not there yet.

  * Do (as root) `ldconfig'.

  * Run (as root) `prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh' to create the device files,
    unless you already have them or are running devfs.

  * Run (as root) `prog/detect/sensors-detect' to detect your hardware,
    put the lines it suggests into /etc/modules.conf
    and enter the modprobe lines sensors-detect suggests.
    Add the line `sensors -s' after the modprobe lines.

  * Reboot, or else type in the modprobe lines and `sensors -s'.

  * Run `sensors' to see your output.

  * That's it! If you have problems, read the INSTALL document and,
    of course our excellent FAQ (doc/FAQ).
