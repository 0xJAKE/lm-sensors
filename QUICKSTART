LM_SENSORS QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------

NOTE: PLEASE SKIM THE INSTALL DOCUMENT, OR BETTER YET READ IT CAREFULLY!
The instructions in this document will generally work if you have a standard
system, but not always!!

Quickstart for i2c option 1 (modules) and lm_sensors option 1 (modules):

  * Make sure you have the kernel tree corresponding to your current
    kernel in /usr/src/linux. Distribution kernels usually won't do,
    compile your own from a 'vanilla' tree (get one from
    ftp://ftp.kernel/org/pub/linux/kernel/).

  * Download, build, and install the latest i2c package.
    This is not necessary if you are using lm_sensors 2.5.5
    with a 2.4 kernel.

  * Do `make'.
    The warnings about .d files at the start are harmless.
    If you have compile problems, you probably should not have skipped step 2.
    Go back and install the latest i2c package.

  * Do (as root) `make install'.

  * Do (as root) `depmod -a'.

  * Add  the line
      /usr/local/lib 
    to /etc/ld.so.conf if it is not there yet.

  * Do (as root) `ldconfig'.

  * Run (as root) `prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh' to create the device files,
    unless you already have them or are running devfs.

  * Run (as root) `prog/detect/sensors-detect' to detect your hardware,
    put the lines it suggests into /etc/modules.conf
    and enter the modprobe lines sensors-detect suggests.
    Add the line `sensors -s' after the modprobe lines.

  * Reboot, or else type in the modprobe lines and `sensors -s'.

  * Run `sensors' to see your output.

  * That's it! If you have problems, read the INSTALL document.
