LM_SENSORS QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------

The instructions in this document will generally work if you have a standard
system, but not always!!

Quickstart for Kernel 2.6 
-------------------------

0) Just compile and install lm-sensors userspace tools. You can do that with:
   'make ; make install'
1) Make sure your kernel has support for all I2C bus drivers and
   'i2c device interface'. If you are using a distribution kernel, all is
   already prepared, you don't need to recompile it.
2) Run 'sensors-detect' command, it will tell you what modules you need to load.
3) Load them and run 'sensors' command, you should see some results.
4) Find right section in /etc/sensors.conf, fix labels, limits, fan divisors
5) Run 'sensors -s' to apply the changes.
